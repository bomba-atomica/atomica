# Atomica Go-to-Market Strategy: Pull-Driven Approach

## Executive Summary

**Target Segment:** Individual bridge arbitrageurs (crypto-native power users)

**Strategy:** Pull-driven, self-service acquisition (no enterprise sales)

**Year 1 Target:** $5M-50M/day volume from 500-2,000 active arbitrageurs

**Key Insight:** Individual arbitrageurs are BOTH sellers AND bidders, solving the two-sided market chicken-and-egg problem organically.

**Why Not Institutions:** Professional market makers (Wintermute, Jump, GSR) require long enterprise sales cycles and are tightly integrated into crypto establishment. Not viable for crypto-native team without connections.

---

## Strategic Rationale: Why Individual Arbitrageurs First

### The Problem with Institutional-First Approach

**Enterprise market makers (Wintermute, Jump Crypto, GSR, Cumberland):**
- ❌ **Requires enterprise sales** (6-12 month cycles)
- ❌ **Need warm introductions** (crypto establishment gatekeepers)
- ❌ **Legal/compliance reviews** (slow, unpredictable)
- ❌ **Lower pain point** (can absorb bridge hack losses)
- ❌ **Risk-averse** (won't try unproven protocols)
- ❌ **Separate bidder recruitment** (DAOs are sellers, need different bidders)

**Why this fails for early-stage crypto-native teams:**
- No existing relationships with institutional players
- Can't get meetings without warm intros
- Sales cycles measured in quarters/years, not weeks
- High risk of 6-12 months of effort with no traction

---

### Why Individual Arbitrageurs Are Superior Launch Target

**1. Pull-Driven GTM (No Enterprise Sales Required)**
- ✅ Discover product organically (SEO, Twitter, GitHub, forums)
- ✅ Self-service onboarding (wallet connect, start trading)
- ✅ Conversion time: hours/days, not months
- ✅ No gatekeepers, no warm intros needed

**2. Solves Chicken-and-Egg Problem (Two-Sided Market Bootstrap)**
- ✅ Arbitrageurs are BOTH sellers AND bidders
- ✅ Self-bootstrapping liquidity
- ✅ Don't need separate bidder recruitment effort
- ✅ One GTM motion serves both sides of market

**3. Highest Pain Point (Existential Motivation)**
- ✅ $2B+ in bridge hacks (2021-2024)
- ✅ One hack = wiped out for individual (vs. institutional players absorb losses)
- ✅ Unhedgeable risk (creates permanent anxiety)
- ✅ Desperate for solution (911 problem, not vitamin)

**4. Daily Trading Frequency (Fast Iteration)**
- ✅ Trade daily (vs. DAOs quarterly/annually)
- ✅ Faster path to volume targets
- ✅ Quick feedback loops for product/pricing
- ✅ Rapid iteration to product-market fit

**5. Community-Driven Growth (Viral Potential)**
- ✅ Active on Crypto Twitter, Discord, Telegram, forums
- ✅ Share profitable strategies (after extracting alpha)
- ✅ Tight-knit community with strong word-of-mouth
- ✅ Early adopters become evangelists

---

**Year 1 target:** 200-1,000 active cross-chain MEV searchers

---

### Priority 3: DeFi Yield Farmers (Manual Arbitrage)

**Profile:**
- Active DeFi users doing manual cross-chain arbitrage
- Not running automated bots (manual trading)
- Trade size: $500-10K per trade
- Frequency: Weekly/monthly (not daily)

---

### De-Prioritized Segments (Year 2+ After Traction)

**Professional Market Makers:**
- Examples: Wintermute, Jump Crypto, GSR, Cumberland
- Why deprioritized: Requires enterprise sales, long cycles, need connections
- When to approach: Year 2+ after demonstrating $50M-500M/day volume
- Expected: Inbound interest after seeing traction

**Large DAOs:**
- Examples: Balancer, ENS, Uniswap DAO, etc.
- Why deprioritized: Governance cycles (months), need proven liquidity first
- When to approach: Month 6+ after individual arbitrageurs establish liquidity
- Expected: Self-serve via governance proposal templates + Safe app

**DeFi-Native Arbitrage Funds:**
- Examples: Pseudonymous/anonymous specialized arbitrage operations
- Why lower priority: Harder to discover, may require some outreach
- When to engage: Emerge organically from individual power user segment
- Expected: 10-50 by Year 1, $5M-50M/day

## Critical Challenge: Bootstrapping Bidder Liquidity

### The Chicken-and-Egg Problem

**Traditional two-sided markets:**
- Sellers won't use platform without buyers (risk of bad pricing)
- Buyers won't participate without volume (not worth infrastructure investment)
- Requires separate GTM efforts for each side

**Why this is HARD:**
- DAOs are sellers only (need separate bidder recruitment)
- Professional market makers require enterprise sales (slow)
- Can't launch until both sides are ready (delays launch)

---

### How Individual Arbitrageurs Solve This

**Key insight: Individual arbitrageurs are BOTH sellers AND bidders**

Unlike traditional two-sided markets, cross-chain arbitrageurs naturally participate on both sides:

**1. As Sellers (Arbitrage Customers):**
- When ETH is cheap on Ethereum, expensive on Arbitrum
- Sell ETH on Ethereum (via Atomica auction)
- Buy ETH on Arbitrum (hedge position)
- Profit from spread

**2. As Bidders (Liquidity Providers):**
- When ETH is expensive on Ethereum, cheap on Arbitrum
- Bid to buy ETH on Ethereum (via Atomica auction)
- Sell ETH on Arbitrum (hedge position)
- Profit from spread

**Result: Self-bootstrapping two-sided market**

---

### Liquidity Bootstrap Timeline

**Month 1-2: Cold Start**
- 20-100 individual arbitrageurs join
- Each participates as seller 50% of time, bidder 50% of time
- Even with low volume, auctions clear competitively
- Example: 50 arbitrageurs × $10K average trade = $500K potential volume per auction
- Competitive pricing emerges (5-10 bidders per auction minimum)

**Month 3-6: Liquidity Flywheel**
- More arbitrageurs join (word-of-mouth)
- More bidders per auction → tighter spreads
- Tighter spreads → attracts non-arbitrage users (yield farmers, small DAOs)
- Non-arbitrage users increase volume
- Higher volume → more profitable for bidders
- More bidders join → even tighter spreads

**Month 6+: Mature Market**
- 200-500 arbitrageurs + 500-2K other users
- Every auction has 20-50 competitive bids
- Spreads compress to 0.1-0.2% (competitive with bridges)
- Professional market makers notice and join (inbound)
- Professional participation further tightens spreads to 0.05-0.15%

---

### Why This Works (Unlike DAO-First Strategy)

| Approach | Sellers | Bidders | Bootstrapping |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Arbitrageur-first** | ✅ Arbitrageurs | ✅ Same arbitrageurs | ✅ Self-bootstrapping |
| **DAO-first** | ✅ DAOs | ❌ Need separate recruitment | ❌ Requires two distinct GTM efforts |
| **Institutional-first** | ❌ Enterprise sales | ❌ Enterprise sales | ❌ Requires two long sales cycles |

---

### Minimum Viable Liquidity Threshold

**Absolute minimum:** 10 active arbitrageurs
- 5 sellers, 5 bidders per auction on average
- Enough for price discovery
- May have wider spreads (0.3-0.5%)

**Competitive market:** 50+ active arbitrageurs
- 20+ bidders per auction
- Spreads compress to 0.15-0.25%
- Competitive with bridge costs

**Mature market:** 200+ arbitrageurs + professional market makers
- 50+ bidders per auction
- Spreads compress to 0.05-0.15%
- Better than bridges on total cost (no risk premium)

**Launch target: 20-100 arbitrageurs in Month 1-2 achieves minimum viable liquidity**

---

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Auction Spreads Wider Than Expected

**Scenario:** Bidder competition is weak, clearing prices are 0.5% away from reference prices

**Impact:** Arbitrageurs prefer bridges despite hack risk (too expensive)

**Mitigation:**
- Liquidity mining for early bidders (fee rebates)
- Publish transparent spread data (attracts more bidders when spreads wide)
- Direct outreach to MEV searchers (recruit sophisticated bidders)
- Adjust auction timing if spreads consistently wide

**Threshold:** If spreads consistently >0.3%, need intervention

---

### Risk 2: 24h Settlement Too Slow for Most Arbitrage

**Scenario:** Most arbitrage spreads close within hours, not available 24h later

**Impact:** Limited addressable opportunities, low volume

**Mitigation:**
- Education: "How to hedge cross-chain arbitrage on Atomica"
- Arbitrageurs can hedge on CEX (lock in spread via offsetting position)
- Settlement delay doesn't matter if hedged
- Consider adding intraday auctions if demand exists

**Threshold:** If <20% of arbitrage opportunities remain profitable with 24h delay, need to reconsider settlement timing

---

### Risk 3: Can't Reach Minimum Viable Liquidity (20-100 Users)

**Scenario:** Marketing efforts fail to attract 20-100 arbitrageurs in Month 1-2

**Impact:** Auctions don't clear competitively, early users churn, negative word-of-mouth

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-launch waitlist building (commit users before launch)
- Liquidity mining incentives (token rewards for early participants)
- Direct outreach to known arbitrageurs (even if requires some 1:1 effort)
- Consider temporary market maker subsidy (pay to provide bids during bootstrap)

**Threshold:** If <10 active arbitrageurs by Month 2, need emergency intervention

---

### Risk 4: Bridge Hacks Stop Happening (Pain Point Disappears)

**Scenario:** Bridge technology improves dramatically, hacks become rare

**Impact:** Primary pain point (existential bridge risk) weakens, less urgency to switch

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on other benefits: cost savings, predictability, native assets
- Expand messaging beyond just safety (efficiency, better UX, MEV protection)
- Target users who've been burned (they won't forget easily)
- Position as "insurance policy" even if hacks slow down

**Threshold:** If 12+ months pass with no major bridge hacks, need messaging pivot
