// Build script for diem-prover-stwo

// Unlike Circom-based provers, stwo doesn't require external circuit compilation
// or verification contract generation. All AIR definitions are written in Rust
// and compiled as part of the normal build process.

fn main() {
    // No build steps required for stwo
    // AIRs are defined directly in Rust code
}
