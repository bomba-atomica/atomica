## Key Concepts

### Atomic Auctions
Novel design combining atomic swaps' trustless cross-chain execution with auction-based competitive price discovery. No bridges, no wrapped tokens, no custodians.

### Futures Market Model
Single daily batch auction with delivery 1-3 hours after auction close (not spot market). Embraces cross-chain latency, enabling better MM economics, liquidity concentration, and simpler mechanism. Settlement delay prevents arbitrage/information withholding and provides verification period.

### Sealed Bids via Timelock Encryption
Bids remain cryptographically sealed until auction close, then automatically decrypt via Atomica validator threshold signatures (BLS-based Identity-Based Encryption). Atomica validators serve dual purposes: consensus and timelock authority. Prevents shill bidding, timing games, and information asymmetry.

**Note:** Atomica chain uses Aptos-core as its blockchain software vendor (consensus, BLS cryptography, Move VM) while running as an independent network.

### Uniform Price Auction
All winning bidders pay the same clearing price (lowest qualifying bid), regardless of original bid. Similar properties to Vickrey auctions under certain conditions (Nobel Prize-winning research).

### Unified Cross-Chain Architecture
All away chains (Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, etc.) use identical verification mechanisms. Dual-layer security: BLS threshold signatures (consensus layer) + ZK proofs (computation layer). Both must agree on merkle root for settlement. Single codebase, consistent UX, unified security model.

### Account Abstraction
Users deposit on preferred chains using familiar wallets (MetaMask, Phantom). Account abstraction maps Ethereum addresses to Atomica accounts. Users sign bids with Ethereum wallet—no Atomica-native wallet or gas tokens needed. Never leave your wallet ecosystem.

### Self-Sustaining Economics
Market makers earn through bid-ask spreads (competitive returns, not excess rents). No protocol fees, no subsidies, no token emissions required.

## Design Principles

Atomica prioritizes:
1. **Trustlessness over convenience** - Cryptographic guarantees, no custodians
2. **Economic sustainability over UX familiarity** - Self-sustaining MM economics
3. **Practical deployability over theoretical privacy** - Timelock encryption, not FHE
4. **Market-driven liquidity over protocol subsidies** - Competitive bidding, no tokens
